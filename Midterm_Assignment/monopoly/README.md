# Monopoly
> Own project/application and testing with mock objects in TDD approach (writing test before code)

Explain your solution with focus on its design. Does it have low coupling, interfaces, polymorphism, Inversion of Control and Dependency injection as central design principles? If not, why? Otherwise, demonstrate it! <br>
> _ _

Explain your test case design activity and argument for the choices that you have made:  <br>
• how to choose the right test conditions (i.e. what to test which in principle will be all code when you are a TDD’er  )? <br>
> _ _

• what test design techniques to use (both consider black-box techniques and white-box technique)? <br>
> _ _

• how much effort to put into each test condition (how critical is the item will influence it’s test coverage percentage)? <br>
