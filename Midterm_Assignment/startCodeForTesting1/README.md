# startCodeForTesting1
This project contains start code for an exercise given at cphbusiness.dk for the educations:
* AP degree in Computer Science
* Top-up Bachelor's degree in Software Developement

● Explain the necessary steps you did to make the code testable, and some of the patterns involved in this step <br>
> _ _

● Execute your test cases <br>
> _ _

● Explain basically about JUnit, Hamcrest, Mockito and Jacoco, and what problems they solve for testers <br>
> _ _

● Demonstrate how you used Mockito to mock away external Dependencies <br>
> _ _

● Demonstrate how/where you did state-based testing and how/where you did behaviour based testing <br>
> _ _

● Explain about Coverage Criterias, using the results presented by running Jacoco (or a similar tool) against you final test code. <br>
> _ _

● Explain/demonstrate what was required to make this project use, JUnit (Hamcrest), Mockito and Jacoco <br>
